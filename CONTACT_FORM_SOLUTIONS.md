# Contact Form Solutions for Free Hosting

## 🎯 The Challenge

You need a solution to process the form data and send emails.

## ✅ Solutions That Work with ANY Free Host

    },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)

.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    if (data.success) {
        showMessage('Thank you! Your message has been sent successfully. We\'ll get back to you soon.', 'success');
        contactForm.reset();
